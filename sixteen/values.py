    to do is to save "key"and "container" attributes, which are used to look up
    or set things in "get" and "set".

    Each Box should have a "consumes" class attribute, too, which is how many
    words that kind of value consumes. It's alright to leave unset, though; the
    default is 0.

    And then there's the "dis" attribute that should be a human-readable string
    ("disassembled") for this value.

    This class (it *is* a base class) doesn't define "__init__", so you'll need
    to subclass and define it yourself.
